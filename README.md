# Exploring the code 

You are provided with a real, though quite simple, experiment code (named TRST for Triangle Rotated Stimulus Test). To run the code you need to have Matlab and [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org) installed. Please explore the code and provide extended answers to the following questions:

1.	Open  [main.m](https://github.com/vbabushkin/CodingChallenge/blob/master/TRST/main.m), run it and go through all the trials. How many points were you able to earn? How easy/difficult it was to earn the points? 
2.	How and where are the results of the experiment stored? What kind of data is collected?
3.	What are your observations about the program? Was it easier to interact with? Are there any changes youâ€™d suggest from a UI perspective? 
4.	The original code is quite complex and hard to read. What changes would you suggest in order to reduce its complexity and make the code readable even for novices?
5.	The original code relies heavily on the global variables that are getting overwritten during the runtime. Why is this undesirable? What you can tell about the component size of current modules/classes/functions?
